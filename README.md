# Playlister

Some scripts to transfer playlists between music streaming services such as Spotify, YouTube, and Apple Music. Maybe I'll make this into a webapp at some point in the future.

See [ytmusicapi documentation](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html) for instructions to access YouTube Music using this script.
See [spotipy documentation](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/#getting-started) for instructions on setting environment variables access the Spotify API using this script.
